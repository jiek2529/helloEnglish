#英语句子结构

1. 一般现在时(现在时)
 >present tense 每日都做的事情（例如爱好）。
 >>I go to work | 我上班 -> 日常事项 -> 现在式
2. 现在进行时
 >present progressive 与 present continuous tense指的是同一种时态，用于表示`正在进行的事情。`
 >>I am going to work | 我要去上班了 -> 当下 -> 现在进行式


* I am never late for work
 >`Subject + To-be(is/am/are) + adverb + extras.`
 >>Eg: She is always on time.
* I never come late
 >Subject + adverb + verb + extras.
 >>Eg: She always comes on time.
* Subject（she）+ verb（danced） + adverb（wanderfully）= 她跳舞跳得很美妙。
* Subject（She）+ verb（danced) + adverb(wonderfully) +place (at her wedding) = 她在她的婚礼上跳舞跳得很美妙。
* Now = 现在（现在时）这里说的是现在的事，所以要用'am'. 我现在累了（I am tired now）
>Am 是现在式的动词（present tense）
* Last night = 昨晚，表示这是过去的事了， 因此我们要用'was'代表过去时， Was-过去时（Past tense）。
* 一般过去式的问句中如果没有动词，那么就要以'was / were'开发。
> He/She - Was
> They/we -were
`Were they busy yesterday? 他们昨天忙吗？`
`Did you watch TV last night? 你昨晚有看电视吗？`
在`含有过去式动词的问句`中要`以did开头，did后的动词形态不变`。


_|现在式|过去式
---|---|---
I | am | was
He | is | was
She | is | was
You | are | were
We | are | were

##问句结构：
1. 质问词 + 助词（do/does） + 主语 + 主动词

2. 质问词 + 助词（is/am/are/do） + 主语 + 主动词
 >>where(哪里) do（于） you（你） work（工作）?

##一般现在式 present tense

he takes a shower at 8:00 AM. | 他早上8点洗澡
I get up at 8 in the morning. | 
I go to work at 12 o'clock. | 描述日常工作时要用一般现在式（present）

##一般过去式 past tense

>Speak - Spoke
>Use - used

动词的过去式用以描述在过去complete的事情
