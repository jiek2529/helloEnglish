#英语句子结构

1. 一般现在时(现在时)
 >present tense 每日都做的事情（例如爱好）。
 >>I go to work | 我上班 -> 日常事项 -> 现在式
2. 现在进行时
 >present progressive 与 present continuous tense指的是同一种时态，用于表示`正在进行的事情。`
 >>I am going to work | 我要去上班了 -> 当下 -> 现在进行式


* I am never late for work
 >`Subject + To-be(is/am/are) + adverb + extras.`
 >>Eg: She is always on time.
* I never come late
 >Subject + adverb + verb + extras.
 >>Eg: She always comes on time.
* Subject（she）+ verb（danced） + adverb（wanderfully）= 她跳舞跳得很美妙。
* Subject（She）+ verb（danced) + adverb(wonderfully) +place (at her wedding) = 她在她的婚礼上跳舞跳得很美妙。
* Now = 现在（现在时）这里说的是现在的事，所以要用'am'. 我现在累了（I am tired now）
>Am 是现在式的动词（present tense）
* Last night = 昨晚，表示这是过去的事了， 因此我们要用'was'代表过去时， Was-过去时（Past tense）。

_|现在式|过去式
---|---|---
I | am | was
He | is | was
She | is | was

##问句结构：

##一般过去式 past tense
`动词的形态会发生变化`
>Live - Lived
>Speak - Spoke
>Use - used
>Study - studied
>Work - worked

动词的过去式用以描述在过去complete的事情
eg: i ate sweets. 我吃了糖
吃 - to eat
吃了 - Ate  'ate'是'eat'的过去式。
>在描述一般过去式的句子中，人称'I,We,They,He,She'接着的did not后的动词形态不变 I did not go to school yesterday (I went to school yesterday.)
