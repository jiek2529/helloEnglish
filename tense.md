###现在进行时的被动语态

例如：

The sports meeting is being held in our school.

我校正在举行运动会.

Another bridge is being built over the Changjiang River.

长江上正在修建另一座大桥.

构成：be + being+过去分词

例如：

A number of Dongfeng trucks are being shipped abroad.

一批东风卡车正被运往国外.

用法：

1）“be being done” 中的动词be应随主语(sing./ pl.)作相应的变化.

2）将现在进行时的主动语态变为现在进行时的被动语态的关键是：把be doing变为be being done.

例1.The students are cleaning the classroom now.

→The classroom is being cleaned now.

现在学生们正在打扫教室.(are cleaning变为is being cleaned)

例2.The boy is counting some eggs.

→Some eggs are being counted.

那男孩正在数蛋.(is counting 变为 are being counted)
